<li>Create a WordPress site on reclaim hosting</li>

          <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/btopro/classicpress-wordpress">Lecture slides from this week</a>
</p>
<p>This week we'll be covering WordPress, the worlds most widely used open source CMS. WordPress is great for simple websites of which the web is made up of many. It's why it powers (estimates, numbers differ by source) 33% to as much as 50% of sites on the internet.</p>
<p>These sites could be everything from the Whitehouse down to every individual blog / new acount on wordpress.com (SaaS solution version) which is why people take some of that number with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>It's a great platform to start your own website on but it's run into some recent controversies which are worth exploring - namely the battle for the heart of the community around a text editor. It's weird to think about, but when a CMS lives and dies by the ease of content entry, you can understand why the <b>new core mandatory</b>



 text editor called<b> Gutenberg</b>



 would attract positive and negative attention.</p>
<p>With plans to phase out the "Classic Editor" in 2020 many people in the community are at a cross-roads: Continue to trust the same core community that "took away" their beloved simple HTML editor, or forge a new path. We'll look briefly at the concept of community forks through the context of ClassicPress, a popular WordPress alternative that's gaining traction as the more community centric CMS.</p>
<p>With parallels to Drupal and it's popular fork Backdrop (topic for next lab) we'll see that it's not always code that leads to inflection points in groups but the process by which that code is formed, agreed upon, and ultimately pushed into the main project everyone's aligned with.</p>
<p>WordPress is a great resume builder both in terms of the platform as well as putting on your resume that you have experience with it, so let's dig in and check it out in <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">ReclaimHosting</a>



 once more!</p>

          <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/btopro/gravcms">Slides about CPanel & GravCMS from class</a>
</p>
<p>This week kicks off <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim hosting</a>



 and our Content Management System section of the course. We're going to be covering four different content management systems in this section of the course leveraging <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim hosting</a>



 to skip a lot of the tediousness of setting up and playing with a CMS.</p>
<p>We'll talk about CPanel in the high level as far as what function it provides and navigate some of the parts of it a bit, though it won't be the focus. CPanel has been around forever (in web terms) and is still a powerful way to abstract away the complexity of managing servers and get you access to installing apps via a nice UI and mild technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Listing CMS "Site building" skills on a resume is a sure fire way to get noticed by certain companies looking for people who can hit the ground running with their internal systems. It demonstrates that you know how to navigate technical systems and can be taught out to administer them (potentially).</p>
<p>It's also a bit crazy as CMSs really are just big storage houses of information with text editors and other UIs that help streamline getting large groups of media and content on the web. The crazy part is, this really isn't that hard to do (as we'll demonstrate through these units) but a lot of people are so afraid of them that they won't touch them.</p>
<p>Master any one of these popular CMSs coming up (especially Drupal coming up) and you'll stand out in any organization that manages web projects or interfaces regularly with the web properties of the company directly.</p>

</p>
<p>Web components are the future of web development. Combined with package management systems like npm, they empower teams to leverage the work of others in a sustainable, secure and accessible manner.</p>
<p>This week is mostly in slide form as a result of the many talks that btopro gives on these topics. This course is built out of web components and increasingly everything from signs at fast food restaurants to websites you use ever day (like YouTube) will be built out of web components.</p>

      <title>Lab 4 - Webcomponents</title>
      <link>/labs/webcomponents-1</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <h3>September 18th, 2019</h3>
<p>For this lab we're going to look at a few different services that are like codepen but allow for more advanced use-cases and development to support web components (and other front end languages).</p>
<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>We're going to look at some different examples in different platforms that are similar to codepen but I also wanted to point out this really slick, business use-case demo from a popular web components company named Vaadin: <a href="https://demo.vaadin.com/customer-crud-app/">https://demo.vaadin.com/customer-crud-app/</a>
</p>
<p><b>Glitch.com</b>







 - A basic example of referencing and leveraging existing web components to do small things and insane things. Buttons, calendars, or... 3d model viewing???</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://glitch.com/~ui5-webcomponents">https://glitch.com/~ui5-webcomponents</a>







</li>

<br/></li>







</ul>
<p><b>Stackblitz.com</b>







 - An example of three different web component libraries achieving the same result through similar syntax: 
<a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/govsummit">https://stackblitz.com/edit/govsummit</a>







</p>
<p><b>Webcomponents.dev</b>







 - A Headless web application example:

</p>
<h3>How to submit to lab</h3>
<p>Similar to last week, we're going to fork and modify something but then we have a specific type of topic prompt for the response:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://webcomponents.dev/edit/KaQ3RE2hDjqwG48OPrnL">Fork this repo just like we did last week</a>




</li>





  <li>Update the details in <b>example-app</b>



 to relate to you</li>





  <li>Copy the <b>example-app</b>



 code and fill it out differently, demonstrating stacking / time savings</li>





  <li>update the CSS code to <b>remove the yellow background </b>




and<b> change the border color</b>




 of the css, impacting all copies (again, scale)</li>





  <li>Do your written response where it says "<i>Here's where you should fill in your response</i>



"</li>




<li>Pick <b>one of these </b>




to frame your writing and video response:	
    <ul>
    	<li>Make the <i>business</i>



, <i>security</i>



, <i>accessibility,</i>



 OR <i>design</i>




 case for using web components, leveraging links to support your case or through demonstration in one of the repos we've stepped through.</li>





      	<li><i>Code / Developer route</i>




: Run through <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/try">Try LitElement</a>




 and do a video explaining the value of LitElement, with supporting links.</li>




<li><i>Package manager / tooling pro</i>



: Setup NPM / node and create an element using Open-WC, the tooling the pros use <a href="https://open-wc.org/guide/">https://open-wc.org/guide/</a>



 and do a video on that process / making a hello-world element in it.</li>





    </ul>





  </li>





  <li>Record your video and link to it from your fork of the repo next to the writing area</li>



<li>Post in <b>#lab-4-webcomponents</b>




 in our slack group</li>



<li><a href="https://reclaimhosting.com">Purchase a domain / account on Reclaim hosting to prepare for next week</a>



</li>

      <title>Lab 3 - HTML / CSS / JS Web basics</title>
      <link>/labs/html-css-js-web-basics</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <h3 class="hax-active">September 11th, 2019</h3>
<p>For this lab we're going to be modifying three CodePens. The first one we'll do together in class for practice and getting a feel for HTML / CSS. JavaScript will come up again in the future so we'll keep the JS brief for this one.</p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/zYOWqKZ">Exercise Pen</a>

: <span style="font-size: var(--haxcms-base-styles-p-font-size, 24px); letter-spacing: var(--haxcms-base-styles-p-letter-spacing, 0.5px); caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">Fork this Pen and we can follow along together in class.</span></p>
<h2>Lab Pen</h2>
<p>For this lab, I want you to modify <b>one of these</b>

 <b>pens</b>

 in order to make the resume reflect your own information. There's a <i>beginner Pen</i>

 and a more <i>advanced pen</i>

.</p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/GRKQVBx?editors=1000">Beginner Pen</a>

: Personal Resume which contains hints and directions inside</p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/GRKxKgX?editors=1000">Advanced Pen</a>

: no instructions and a slightly more advanced design. Use this to challenge yourself or if you've previously written HTML to make something more useful.</p>
<h3 class="hax-active">Reflection Pen</h3>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/KKPozvd">FORK THIS PEN</a>

: For reflection this week I want you to fork this pen and write your response using HTML. For the topic this week pick one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Explaining how to apply styling to an element in <b>CSS</b>

</li>

<li>Explain how to use JavaScript and <b>getElementById</b>

 to add a <i>click event to</i>

 an element in an existing codepen that generates an alert saying <b>Hello</b>

</li>

<li><i>Value of CodePen as a platform</i>

 to learn coding by finding an inspiring pen and explain what's going on.</li>

<ul>

<li>Web components and "components" as in designed pieces of websites are different things (but related). Components could be like a product shown on the Walmart website. A Web component would be if Walmart used and designed a <i style="">< walmart-product type="homepage" sku="3u447748839" ></i>


 kind of a thing. It's the parallel to the design asset but now it's an encapsulated, stackable item that can be reused and maintained in one place.</li>


<ul><li>This is a common misconception in industry too</li>


</ul>


<li>Apparently <a href="https://codeburst.io/6-reasons-you-should-use-native-web-components-b45e18e069c2">https://codeburst.io/6-reasons-you-should-use-native-web-components-b45e18e069c2</a>

<ul><li><span style="font-size: 24px; caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When you include links, videos, images, etc in your video, try to copy and paste the link into the description on YouTube . This helps others explore the topics in greater detail<b> </b>

</ul>





</ul>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Lab 2</span></h3>
<ul><li>When you include links, videos, images, etc in your video, try to <b>copy and paste the link into the description on <i>YouTube</i>







</b>







. This helps others explore the topics in greater detail (general screen-caster tip)<br/></li>







<li>Frame topics in a vacuum, not in the context of our course. Act like this is a video you're making just to explain a topic to explain it. Next year someone might care about how to make a <b>Pull Request </b>







and learn from you, they won't know (or care) about IST 402 or that it's for school</li>







<ul><li><b>Job interview</b>







: I know how to do X, I can explain Y. Less <i>In class I learned about X, </i>







I did an <i>assignment once</i>







 about Y.</li>







</ul>








<li>Be mindful of time. It's hard (for me too) but the 2.5 to 5 minute target helps with engagement as well as helps you refine your words when speaking about topics fluidly</li>







<ul><li><b>Job interview</b>







: Be on point, precise in language, exacting in explanations and you demonstrate confidence in the topic matter.</li>







</ul>








<li>WRITE BEFORE SPEAKING. The blogging / writing aspect of the lab response is to help practice technical writing but also to frame your thoughts and find words that work for concepts.</li>







<ul><li>500 words == 5 minutes; 300, 3 minutes; these values are to help you get more exact in your language both written and verbal</li>







</ul>







<li><i>Walking and Chewing Gum is difficult</i>







 - You are not being judged on accuracy of things like "Did you issue the pull request perfectly that one time". Try to demonstrate the concept on video, live. Practice once beforehand if it helps smooth things out.</li>







<ul><li><b>Job interview</b>







: Thinking on the fly, not planned out canned responses to things. Fluid conversation mixing in and out of technical concepts isn't easy, that's why we're practicing it.</li>







</ul>







<li>To those treating this like a brand / identity, keep doing what your doing, many of these are flipping fantastic!</li>








</ul>
<h3>Lab 1</h3>
<ul><li>ABOB (made up acronym) - Always Be On Brand. Similar account names, same photos, interlink social accounts with writing with posts</li>










<li>Always leave 2-3 seconds on the front and back of a screencast</li>









<li>Do an audio levels check</li>









<li>Shoot for the same style sign on and sign off</li>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>There are no required course materials in the textbook form but there are digital services you'll need to purchase for one of our Labs which will have usage in multiple labs in the future. These services are hosting from <a href="https://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a>



 and a domain name from a registrar like <a href="https://hover.com/">Hover</a>



 or <a href="https://domains.google.com">Google Domains</a>



.</p>
<h3 class="hax-active">Referral link</h3>
<p><a href="https://m.do.co/c/1fd5a3e0425d">ELMS:LN / HAXTheWeb referral link</a>


</p>
<p>If you use this referral link you should get at least 1 month free. <b>This is linked to an account the university uses</b>


 for people to get access to HAXcms and ELMS:LN demos in a safe, offsite location. This is also my way of saying that I don't benefit personally from you using Digital Ocean, I just like their simplicity.</p>
<p>These services were selected for price point and ease of use. We will be going through all the steps of setting up a new server on Digital Ocean (which involves clicking buttons basically) and then getting our custom domain name wired up to the Digital Ocean server.</p>
<p>There are $5/month plans on Digital Ocean and domain names can typically be purchased for $12.99/year though can run as low as $5 when on sale. After class is over it's up to you if you want to keep paying for hosting / keep your domain name active but expect to spend between <b>$25 and $50</b>
 depending on service you sign up for and domain name cost.</p>
<p>Paying more will get you access to faster server resources but are not required for what we're going to execute on the machine. <span style="font-size: var(--haxcms-base-styles-p-font-size, 24px); letter-spacing: var(--haxcms-base-styles-p-letter-spacing, 0.5px); caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">We will be setting up the server and talking about how to wire things up most likely as part of our 4th lab session of the semester.</span></p>

      <title>Screencasting</title>
      <link>/resources/screencasting</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <h3 class="hax-active">Checklist</h3>
<p>Before recording always make sure...</p>
<ul><li>You've got the links you want to view open in tabs in a browser window</li>
<li>You've got headphones / some kind of microphone to record your voice</li>
<ul><li>You can use internal microphones but the quality on them is pretty bad so try to use a headset / earbuds if you have them</li>
</ul>

<li>You've authorized whatever it is to record your voice and test that audio is working!</li>
<ul><li>I fell victim to this many times early on</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Next you'll need to pick a screen casting tool to do the recording. I recommend one of the following.</p>
<h3>Zoom (Free)</h3>
<p><b>Link</b>
: <a href="https://cmm.psu.edu/zoom/">https://cmm.psu.edu/zoom/</a>
</p>
<p>Penn state labs come with zoom installed. You can also install this on your personal device and should be able to do recordings from it. I recommend finding a quite place that you can bring headphones since you'll have to do voice over describing what's on screen and explaining it to others.</p>
<h3>Screencastify (Free, ad based with paid option)</h3>
<p><b>Link</b>
: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screencastify-screen-vide/mmeijimgabbpbgpdklnllpncmdofkcpn?hl=en">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screencastify-screen-vide/mmeijimgabbpbgpdklnllpncmdofkcpn?hl=en</a>
</p>
<p>I just found this recently, it's a browser plugin for Chrome. If <i>you're O.K. with the permissions that it requires</i>
, it's a very easy to use way of generating a screencast.</p>
<h3 class="hax-active">Snagit (Paid)</h3>
<p><b>Link</b>
: 
<a href="https://www.techsmith.com/snagit-pricing.html">https://www.techsmith.com/snagit-pricing.html</a>
</p>
<p>I use Snagit personally for all of my screen casting that I do. It is $30 but comes with some basic ways of doing quick editing and image mock up as well. It's not required that you use Snagit by any means, just saying what I've had positive experiences with previously.</p>
<p>Others</p>
<p>If you find others that you like feel free to share them with the class. The purpose of this class is not to get into high end video editing so beware that it is expected you'll generate videos each week. The content of the video is what matters, not fancy intros or well cut jumps or anything like that. Being able to fluidly communicate about a technical concept and teach others about how to use it and what it is.</p>

      <title>Lab 2 - Git / Github / Contribution</title>
      <link>/labs/git</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>
</p>
<h2>September 4th, 2019 - Lab 2</h2>
<p>We've talked about git for version control and explored Github a bit and how teams work together using the platform. Now let's dig in!</p>
<h3>Basic example / Getting started</h3>
<ol><li>Create a <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub account</a>












</li>













<li>Go to this repo off btopro's github account <a href="https://github.com/btopro/lab2/blob/master/README.md">by going to this link</a>







</li>










<li>Read along in the document and complete the tasks asked of you</li>











<li>We'll work through this in class and I'll mix between showing things interactively done between specific people as well as roaming around to answer questions</li>










<li>After you make the updates requested in the document, issue a "Pull Request" back against the source (my repo)</li>










<li>In the PR, fill out a brief overview of what you changed. This is the feedback loop typically found in modern web development!</li>












</ol>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Let's start contributing to an open source project!</span></h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Let's start contributing to our first open source project! I've left a few issues in my own projects so that we can see the full project development life cycle at play here. I'm providing links below so your job is to fix one of these things and issue a pull request just like we did in the practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">EVERYONE (me included) start out getting into a development community by updating documentation, making sure acronyms made sense and fixing links and typos. The best way to get into a software community is to fix things around the edges and ensure that you can effectively communicate with people in the project. It also helps prove they are human.</span></p>
<ol><li>Select one of the issues from this list of issues; Pick one from the number based on the row you are sitting in if still in class, if not, try to pick one that hasn't been closed yet or have comments on it.</li>






<ol><li>
HAXcms minor documentation clean up -<a href="https://github.com/elmsln/HAXcms/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHAXEdu">https://github.com/elmsln/HAXcms/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHAXEdu</a>






<br/>OR</li>






<li>HAXTheWeb minor documentation clean up - <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/haxtheweb.org/labels/HAXedu">https://github.com/elmsln/haxtheweb.org/labels/HAXedu</a>





<br/>OR</li>




<li>ELMS:LN minor documentation clean up - 
<a href="https://github.com/elmsln/elmsln/labels/HAXedu">https://github.com/elmsln/elmsln/labels/HAXedu</a>




<br/>OR</li>





<li>Add a <b>proper</b>

 description of the course to the <a href="https://github.com/btopro/ist402">https://github.com/btopro/ist402</a>





 README.md file and provide an issue describing the need to make the change<br/></li>






</ol>









<li>Read the description of what needs fixed, ask questions if you need clarification via commenting in the associated thread</li>










<li>Hit FORK on the repo (or go to your fork), fix the issue and submit a pull request.</li>









</ol>
<h3 class="hax-active"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Writing / screencast / reflection lab submission</span></h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">For our reflection piece this week, pick one of the following topics (or multiple if you like)</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.5px;">Markdown<br/></span></li>







<li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.5px;">Git</span></li>







<li><span style="letter-spacing: 0.5px;">Pull Requests</span></li>







</ul>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">In your screencast talk about one of these four above as far as what it is and then showcase it in context of what we did in the lab. This could involve talking about what Pull Requests are while showing off a link that has good tutorials on Pull Request workflows, then showing the relevant links in the project you selected associated with a pull Request. <b>It could also be showing you talking about proposing changes to a file in a repo, then doing it in the UI and talking about what's happening.</b>







</span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">I only bold that text because then you'd be saving time; doing the Lab while talking about doing the lab; which demonstrates you get the concept, while showing someone else how to accomplish the same task.</span></p>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Submitting your reflection</span></h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">This week our blogging piece will take place in the fork of your github repo for Lab2. There's a boilerplate file I created called <b><i>lab2/blob/master/Reflection.md</i>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <h2>August 28th, 2019 - Lab 1 / first class</h2>
<p>This is a warm up lab that will help set the stage for the platforms we'll use for the rest of the semester.</p>
<ol><li>Create a Slack account and join two slack channels</li>











<ul><li><b style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">IST 402</b>











<span style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);"> - <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/ist-402/shared_invite/enQtNzI5OTAyMTczNjY1LTUzZDQ1ZDFmMmU1ZTM1MTViN2QyNDAyNWJkYjgwZDhlYzc3ZDNhYTc1MjhhZWJhNjAyYjIxOGJlMWM2MGI3NGM">Slack Invite</a>








</span></li>











<ul><li>We'll use this as the primary working space / link sharing / communication space for the course</li>











</ul>











<li><b style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">ELMS: Learning Network - </b>

</span></li>











<ul><li>Me and my band of nuts are available to you. If you want to get more involved in this space beyond what we'll experience in class or have questions about the education or web industry, the door is always open</li>

<li>There's developers and educational professionals from multiple universities there, IST and otherwise.</li>











</ul>











</ul>












<li>Think up a brand / identity / persona for your online identity as an IT professional</li>











<ul><li>What does your brand feel like?</li>











<ul><li>Great Explainer? Hero's Journey? Future CIO?</li>











</ul>











<li>Pick a name that you can attempt to use across "all platforms"</li>











<ul><li>Domain name, Github, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube</li>











</ul>











<li>Note: You MAY want to divorce this from your real persona / personal accounts. Everyone does it differently in industry; many merge, there are risks associated with that. I fragment on YouTube  but generally keep all mine unified.<br/></li>

<li>Because we haven't started a blog yet (but let's get in the swing of doing a write up and a video), write up a paragraph describing your brand in Word/Docs</li>











</ul>











<li>Register this account on Github, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube</li>











<ul><li><span style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">Be sure to set the username to be the same across them</span></li>











</ul>











<li>Create a Playlist on YouTube called "Clarissa explains it all", replacing <span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Clarissa</span> with your persona</li>











<li>Create a screencast that's 3 - 5 minutes long that includes the following:</li>











<ul><li><span style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">Pick a screencasting solution <a href="resources/screencasting">from the Screencasting resources area</a>


</span></li>



<li><span style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">introducing your channel <i><b>from a technology professional context</b>






</i>






</span></li>










<li><span style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">Showing your favorite tech blog / anything you've read and enjoy learning from online currently. Talk about an article on the blog while it's being shown in order to practice the explainer concept.</span></li>










<li><span style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">End with what piece of technology you'd like to learn more about how it works from the topics in the survey</span></li>










</ul>










<li><span style="caret-color: rgb(25, 30, 35);">Post a link to this video on your social accounts (Twitter / LinkedIn) with some setup to try and draw people to it using 3 hashtags.</span></li>

<li><span style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">Use the </span><b style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">IST402 Slack directly</b>

      <title>Labs</title>
      <link>/labs</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>We'll have a lab almost every week of the semester which we'll start in class and then will be yours to finish on your own time. Most labs should be able to be completed in 1-2 hours total.</p>
<p><b>Remember that after each lab you have to do a concise overview of the topic in the form of a blog post and a YouTube explainer video, then submit it to Slack for review.</b>
</p>
<p>We'll start out class the following week reviewing some videos and posts created by the class to point out what worked well and what could have been done better in presenting the previous topic.</p>

      <title>After class reflection</title>
      <link>/after-class-reflection</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>All assignments are setup as labs and you'll be starting into them at the end of class. Once finished with the lab, <b>you'll demonstrate you've done the work by reflecting on it in the form of a written response as well as a video response. </b>
Then we'll review some of the responses at the start of the next class. <b>Scroll down to read both things that you are expected to complete each week as part of reflection on the topic of the lab. Yes I enjoy bold text.</b>

</p>
<h3>Written response</h3>
<p>To each technology, I'd like you to write a short blog post that reads like a one-page white paper about the technology at hand. Try to keep it to around 500 words but thoroughness is more important then "did I make the paper long enough".</p>
<p>As long as it answers questions like the following:</p>
<ul><li>What is it and why does it exist</li>

<li>What industries use it / who are players that popularize it?</li>

<li>What alternatives exist to it?</li>

<li>Links / Resources for people who want to learn more about it</li>

<li>What you struggled with in using it?</li>

<li>What you liked most about using it?</li>

</ul>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;" class="hax-active">Video response</span></h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Explainer videos are great, especially for people on the go via podcasts or who are looking to get a refresher on a topic before a meeting. Make a 3-5 minute screencast that sets up what the topic is, and runs through some brief examples of it. This is open to interpretation but you are trying to explain to others why this topic is valuable and when they'd use it.</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="hax-active">Say quickly who you are</span></li>

<li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Explain in 30 seconds what the topic is, who's using it or why it's useful</span></li>

<li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Talk about the topic while showing a demo of it or place you found most useful to learn</span></li>

<li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Show links to resources where you can learn more about it</span></li>

<li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Awesome sign off phrase to remember you by</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Here are a few examples of the kind of formality that is expected (flip on screencast software, record screen, talk). Part of the video reflection is to get more comfortable with speaking about technical concepts and to improve your ability to rationalize what your doing. I don't use a script (ever) for my videos but that's up to you.</span></p>

      <title>Goals.. for you!</title>
      <link>/goals-for-you-</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>My primary goal for you is to learn new things about modern web technologies while getting hands on with them. More specifically...</p>
<ul><li>Learning not just what a technology is but...</li>

<ul><li>Who's using it, what industries, what web services</li>

<li>Getting hands on and implementing it small scale</li>

<li>Being able to better communicate purpose and ideas around it</li>

</ul>


<li>Building a digital footprint of YOU, the IT worker / manager / developer / whatever your path, just that it's out there!</li>

<ul><li>Creating a YouTube channel of explainer videos about the topics discussed in class</li>

<li>Creating a Blog about these same topics</li>

<li>Creating social coder accounts and connecting them all together (like Github, TravisCI, Stackblitz, CodePen, Glitch, IFTTT, etc)</li>

</ul>

<li>Learn about all levels of "the stack" in order to better empathize with those working in different levels of the stack from you (or people you'll one day manage)</li>

<li>Have a website on the internet that you control and have a window into how all aspects of it function.</li>
<li><i>Take hand written tests</i>
 and <i>use platforms and technologies that no employer on earth will care about</i>
 once you graduate</li>

</ul>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Ok.. maybe not that last one but the rest are legit.</span></p>

      <title>Class time together</title>
      <link>/class-time-together</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>We're going to strive for this general flow to each week of the semester. A few specific topics will deviate and we may have some guest speakers, but generally this is what class will look like together</p>
<ul><li>Capability / skill / technology of the day with quick discussion of what people think that's for, or places they've heard of it previously</li>

<li>A brief lecture (25 - 30 min) about the skill, who uses it, and how it's put into practice. This is taking the concept into the theory realm.</li>

<li>Screw theory, we're only going to learn by getting our hands dirty! We'll take a quick break to prep the keyboards. (10 min for questions, 5 min break)</li>

<li>Next we'll all follow along doing a very basic example of the skill / a warm up activity. This might be running commands in a terminal or hooking up a new IFTTT command to Github via the UI. Something that's all of us following along and doing it together, stopping to answer any questions along the way.</li>

<li>The rest of the time from here is open lab. We'll have a lab each week with a few options for experiencing and implementing the skill in practice.</li>

<li>What ever you don't get done in class is to be completed after class but we'll always start on the work together in case there are issues.</li>

</ul>

      <title>Project</title>
      <link>/project</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>The last week of the semester there will be a slightly longer lab that I'm calling a project. You'll have to put together a pitch for one of multiple problem spaces but it's a technical pitch. You'll be asked to use as many technologies we used in the course to express how you'll solution will utilize these technologies, while it still being in the form of a pitch.</p>
<p>This will be explained more as we go into the course but it's effectively a double lab as far as points and time involved. There is no final exam so it's just a final project</p>

      <title>Building your digital identity</title>
      <link>/topics/building-your-digital-identity</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/btopro/edtechjoker-ist-402-syllabus-day">Slides from the talk in class</a>

</p>
<p>No one knows who you are if you're not effectively communicating. I recall a colleague several years ago getting pissed that I was invited to speak some place. "It's like no one knows I exist or appreciates what I know". He was absolutely just as or more tallented than I was... what was the difference?</p>
<ul><li>I've blogged openly about tech and life since 2008</li>



<li>I've got hundreds of YouTube videos ranging from "Hey look at this thing" to "let's learn about..." to "We're going to burn down this space"</li>




<li>I've got unified social media accounts that signal boost content from the other spaces</li>



</ul>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">As a result of having a unified social media front and regular presence on blogs / YouTube, I've gotten to speak nationally on a regular basis the last ten years. <b>Every recorded association of a brand or event to you personally is another form of signal boosting.</b>



</span></p>
<h3 class="hax-active"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Theory</span></h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">A theory I learned about in Grad school that stuck with me the most is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory">Actor Network Theory</a>



 (ANT). ANT can be argued as to if it's actually a theory, but the <b>TLDR;</b>



 is that all things influence each other.</span></p>
<a11y-gif-player src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/aVtdz7iNVPI1W/giphy.gif" src-without-animation="https://media2.giphy.com/media/aVtdz7iNVPI1W/480w_s.jpg" alt="full house animation of young daughter saying DUH and rolling eyes" schema-resource-id="#d7c9f858-a9be-b117-7795" resource="#d7c9f858-a9be-b117-7795" prefix="oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org " style="width: 25%;"></a11y-gif-player>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">For information sciences though, it's saying that anything created influences anything else created. This is particularly potent in the digital space when we can create a logo, brand, business, website, identity, or platform seemingly out of thin air. If I post on YouTube, I'm not just broadcasting there and increasing my brand recognition in that space. It's aggregated to blogs, it shows up in Google and Bing search results. Its lifted for replication on Russian botnet sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">All of this, amplifies your voice and reach far beyond you speaking in public (again, duh). But if you recognize this, you can also weaponize it to your advantage (or be a Russian troll bot online and corrupt other countries cultures, I mean tomatoe tomatto). Through intentionality, we can increase our profile as technology professionals and begin to build a portfolio that anyone can stumble on (or seek out intentionally) to increase their knowledge.</span></p>

      <title>Questions driven teaching</title>
      <link>/question-driven-teaching</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>In all the technologies and skillsets we'll explore in this course, I want you to approach them with the same questions that I have explored in my career. These simple questions will help you decipher what's going to get you the furthest for the longest.</p>
<p>Technological sustainability is not easy; both in remaining relevant by sustaining your own skills as well as the sustained use of any solution by anyone or their organization.</p>
<p>What problem does this solve?</p>
<p>Who built this?</p>
<p>Where is this being used?</p>
<p>How can I go about using it?</p>
<p>Why do people use this over alternatives? (and what are the top 3 alternatives)</p>
<p>With each problem / solution space we look at in this course we're going to look at it through the lens of these questions.</p>

          <![CDATA[ <p>It's not as scary as that title.</p>
<p>We'll be exploring lots of different technologies through labs. In order to give me a good sense of what everyone's past experience is with these technologies, please complete the very short anonymous skills survey.</p>
<p>You aren't judged on this or graded, it's just to help me know how best to pace the course so that we can make the best use of our time together.</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/BpRv39fV5jZFMLg77">Open the above survey in a new window</a>

</p>
<p>This is just to help me get a sense of things everyone has had past experience with so I know what to focus on in what order and in how much depth. These labs are designed to give you working knowledge of all of the things listed and to be able to have a conversation with managers, hiring groups, and developers about the tools IT organizations / start ups need to utilize on a daily basis.</p>
