<p>While touching on many, here is a list of technologies we'll be exploring throughout the course. These tools are not used by every organization out there, but huge swaths of the start up scene will have these or solutions like them.</p>
<h2 class="hax-active">Git / Github / Version control</h2>
<p>Quickly becoming the developer account portal to the start up universe, Github is both code management platform and project management platform. It can be used for open source software (which made it so popular) but also paid plans allow for private repos.</p>
<p>Socially, many use github data (commits, stars, discussions, pull requests) to demonstrate effectiveness in communities. We'll use github to give you the following skills:</p>
<ul><li>Make an account if you don't already have one</li>
<li>Learn the terms of the trade and what Github is a UI on top of</li>
<li>Learn how to do Pull Requests</li>
<li>Learn</li>
</ul>
