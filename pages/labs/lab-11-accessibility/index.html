<p>Web accessibility is just one piece of the accessibility pie but we're attuned to its importance. The next thing though is how do we use tools to help build more accessible things and remediate what we already have?</p>
<h2>Prelab / in class doing</h2>
<p>Let's install the <b>WAVE Evaluation Tool</b>
 and <b>Lighthouse</b>
 plugins for Chrome / Firefox.</p>
<p>Let's work through some accessibility issues in a code pen to get some basics down</p>
<p>Codepen: <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/a11y-issues?file=index.html" style="font-family: var(--haxcms-base-styles-body-font-family, &quot;Noto Serif&quot;, serif); letter-spacing: var(--haxcms-base-styles-body-letter-spacing, 0.5px);">https://stackblitz.com/edit/a11y-issues?file=index.html</a>
</p>
<p>Let's check out these websites and read through the <b>Lighthouse score and WAVE </b>
to understand issues and see what real reports look and feel like</p>

<h2>Lab Scenario</h2>
<p>You are a consultant bring brought in to help out a web team organized by someone with <b>your exact name</b>
, that has a site builder with <b>the same name</b>
, and oddly a developer also with... the <b>same name</b>
 (weird..)! You work at A11y for All inc (great company name...) and you are here because of concerns by the web team that past projects were not correctly audited for performance and accessibility.<span> (WTF?! WHY DIDN'T THE INSTRUCTOR TELL US TO AUDIT OUR STUFF ALONG THE WAY).</span></p>
<p>Your CEO, Admiral Akbar is <i><b>piiiiiiiiiiiist</b>
</i>
</p>

<p>"It's ok though CEO Akbar", you assure the CEO, "you're paying our exorbitant rates to solve this problem for you. We'll even teach your team how to solve these problems to avoid issues in the future!"</p>

<h2>Lab what to do</h2>
<ul><li>Audit any of the past CMS projects using <b>Lighthouse</b>
 and <b>WAVE</b>
</li>
<li>If there's anything simple in content that you can fix, remediate it, but the goal here is understanding how to interpret the reports and explain how the problems found can be remediated.</li>
<li>Use your past HAXcms site to add a page of content with screenshots of your lighthouse scores</li>
<li>On that page, put your video explaining the following..</li>
</ul>
<h2>Video what to cover</h2>
<p>For your video I want you to <b>explain how you ran an accessibility and performance audit of a website</b>
. This can be one of the websites your worked on in class OR (and probably more meaningful) perform this audit on a club, organization or other website that's associated with you or that you can actually have an impact on by running this audit and providing feedback.</p>
<p>Make sure to explain what the audit is, why it's important, and then a bit about how the site can leverage the scores to make improvements. Don't just say "it needs to improve accessibility" take at least one of the points and explain what a remediation would look like in order to improve. This can be from the WAVE or Lighthouse feedback.</p>
<h2>Submission Rubric</h2>
<p>Ran reports and posted screenshots to HAXcms site <b>(4 pts)</b>
</p>
<p>Recorded a video accurately explaining what the reports generate and how they are useful <b>(6 pts)</b>
</p>
<p><b>10 point lab</b>
</p>
<p>Post link to page in HAXcms site with the video included in<b> #lab11-accessibility</b>
</p>
