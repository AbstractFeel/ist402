<h2 id="header-4960b5ea-613e-88a6-eb4c-b1466d9dedeb">Lab 2</h2>
<p>We've talked about git for version control and explored Github a bit and how teams work together using the platform. Now let's dig in!</p>
<h3 id="header-b818e0ae-3747-1061-bade-b8b5cfc9f94c">Basic example / Getting started</h3>
<ol><li>Create a <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub account</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/btopro/ist402">Fork the repo backing this course</a>
</li>
<li>Go to <b>files/spring2020.md</b>
 and edit the file by clicking the pencil</li>
<li>Write markdown that adds the name of your brand and a link to your YouTube channel</li>
<li>Add a commit message saying that you added your link and hit Commit</li>
<li>Click <b>Pull Request</b>
 and create a new pull request</li>
<li>In the message for it indicate that you added the link to your channel and submit the PR.</li>
<li>We'll do this in class and look at the graph it forms</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="header-97dc74c8-1939-c146-a51f-14ec84a42e13"><span>Contributing to projects</span></h2>
<p><span>EVERYONE (me included) start out getting into a development community by updating documentation, making sure acronyms made sense and fixing links and typos. The best way to get into a software community is to fix things around the edges and ensure that you can effectively communicate with people in the project. It also helps prove they are human.</span></p>
<p><span>For the lab this week let's build a living glossary of the terms and technologies we're going to cover this semester and then use the standard way of contributing to projects in order to contribute back to the course.</span></p>
<ol><li>Go to the course repo and see the <a href="https://github.com/btopro/ist402/blob/master/files/glossary.md">files/glossary.md</a>
 file. This is the file that's powering the content in the Additional resources / Glossary portion of the course website</li>
<li>Look through the listed and claim a term that you are going to contribute a definition for.</li>
<li>How to claim a term:</li>
<ol><li><a href="https://github.com/btopro/ist402/issues">Go to the issue queue for the course</a>
</li>
<li>Create a new issue called "Definition for ____" where the blank is the word you are going to define. Once a word is listed you must select a different one</li>
</ol>
<li><span>Do some research to come up with a working definition of the word for the course. Write your definition for it in markdown in the file below the heading for the word</span></li>
<li><span>Provide 2 to 3 links to additional resources about the defined word</span><br/></li>
<li><span>Issue a Pull Request back to the course repository with the name of the topic that you selected as the title of the PR</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="header-762bab98-74cb-13ea-2f00-cda79e9ae4be"><span>Writing / screencast / reflection lab submission</span></h3>
<p><span>The reflection this week (writing portion) was creating the pull request that defined a term from the course this semester. For your video,</span></p>
<ul><li><span>Markdown<br/></span></li>
<li><span>Git</span></li>
<li><span>Pull Requests</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In your screencast talk about one of these four above as far as what it is and then showcase it in context of what we did in the lab. This could involve talking about what Pull Requests are while showing off a link that has good tutorials on Pull Request workflows, then showing the relevant links in the project you selected associated with a pull Request. <b>It could also be showing you talking about proposing changes to a file in a repo, then doing it in the UI and talking about what's happening.</b>
</span></p>
<p><span>I only bold that text because then you'd be saving time; doing the Lab while talking about doing the lab; which demonstrates you get the concept, while showing someone else how to accomplish the same task.</span></p>
<h3 id="header-64ed5030-ef76-cd1b-3db5-1a8cc128447a"><span>Submitting your video / reflection</span></h3>
<p>To submit your reflection, provide a link to the Pull Request you made in the <b>#lab-2-git</b>
 channel. Along with a link to your video submission for the week.</p>
