<h3>September 18th, 2019</h3>
<p>For this lab we're going to look at a few different services that are like codepen but allow for more advanced use-cases and development to support web components (and other front end languages).</p>
<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>We're going to look at some different examples in different platforms that are similar to codepen but I also wanted to point out this really slick, business use-case demo from a popular web components company named Vaadin: <a href="https://demo.vaadin.com/customer-crud-app/">https://demo.vaadin.com/customer-crud-app/</a>
</p>
<p><b>Glitch.com</b>







 - A basic example of referencing and leveraging existing web components to do small things and insane things. Buttons, calendars, or... 3d model viewing???</p>

<h3>How to submit to lab</h3>
<p>Similar to last week, we're going to fork and modify something but then we have a specific type of topic prompt for the response:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://webcomponents.dev/edit/KaQ3RE2hDjqwG48OPrnL">Fork this repo just like we did last week</a>




</li>





  <li>Update the details in <b>example-app</b>



 to relate to you</li>





  <li>Copy the <b>example-app</b>



 code and fill it out differently, demonstrating stacking / time savings</li>





  <li>update the CSS code to <b>remove the yellow background </b>




and<b> change the border color</b>




 of the css, impacting all copies (again, scale)</li>





  <li>Do your written response where it says "<i>Here's where you should fill in your response</i>



"</li>




<li>Pick <b>one of these </b>




to frame your writing and video response:	
    <ul>
    	<li>Make the <i>business</i>



, <i>security</i>



, <i>accessibility,</i>



 OR <i>design</i>




 case for using web components, leveraging links to support your case or through demonstration in one of the repos we've stepped through.</li>





      	<li><i>Code / Developer route</i>




: Run through <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/try">Try LitElement</a>




 and do a video explaining the value of LitElement, with supporting links.</li>




<li><i>Package manager / tooling pro</i>



: Setup NPM / node and create an element using Open-WC, the tooling the pros use <a href="https://open-wc.org/guide/">https://open-wc.org/guide/</a>



 and do a video on that process / making a hello-world element in it.</li>





    </ul>





  </li>





  <li>Record your video and link to it from your fork of the repo next to the writing area</li>



<li>Post in <b>#lab-4-webcomponents</b>




 in our slack group</li>



<li><a href="https://reclaimhosting.com">Purchase a domain / account on Reclaim hosting to prepare for next week</a>
