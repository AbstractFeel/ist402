<p>This week we're going to improve upon our brand by through critique and self reflection. We want to get our brands in as good a shape as possible prior to all the hands on labs and topics we'll be engaging in this semester.</p>
<h2>Critique</h2>
<p>Look back through the <b>#lab-1-brand </b>
Slack<b> </b>
channel and pick <b>three brands by your classmates</b>
 at random (or friends, which ever). Watch their video and how they present themselves as well as take note of any images, naming, or social media complements they've made to their brand.</p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>I want you to produce <b>three recommendations for each of the three brands</b>
 you selected on how they can improve their brand (these can be bullet points). Things they could do to more effectively communicate either verbally or in their social media presence.</p>
<p>Then I want you to reflect on your own brand and come up with <b>three ways you could improve your brand</b>
 based on the ones you saw.</p>
<h2>Video Reflection</h2>
<p>For your video reflection I want you to produce a video explaining the phrase SEO. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, and it's something we're actively engaging in through this course. By generating lots of content on different platforms with similar names, we're training SEO / Google-bot web crawlers to index and make our brands send our content higher in search results.</p>
<p>Make a video explaining SEO, how you can improve it, and then how you plan on improving your brand in order to enhance your SEO.</p>
<h2>Rubric</h2>
<ul><li>Did you review three other brands and provide 3 pieces of feedback on each? (4 pts)</li>
<li>Did you reflect on your own brand and come up with real areas for improvement? (2 pts)</li>
<li>Did you communicate effectively about the importance of SEO? (4 pts)</li>
</ul>
<p>When complete, submit to the <b>#lab-3-brand-review</b>
 channel on slack by Sunday.</p>
<p></p>
