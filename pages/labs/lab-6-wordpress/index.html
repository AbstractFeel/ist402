<h2>Lab Context</h2>
<ul><li>You are the project manager that sold your team and CEO on using Grav</li>




<li>Grav is going great, but there are rumblings from some clients recently and team members used to WordPress are asking for it.</li>




<li><b>Client 1</b>
 is also concerned about this "New Editor" they keep hearing about. Some want to try it out, others like things the way it is now because of training.</li>




<li><b>Client 2</b>
 is questioning why you selected Grav for their project and wants you to review if they should be using WordPress because of other projects they are using it on.</li>
