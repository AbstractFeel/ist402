<h2>Lab Context</h2>
<ul><li>You are the project manager that sold your team and CEO on using Grav</li>



<li>Grav is going great, but there are rumblings from some clients and team members used to WordPress</li>



<li>Â Client 1 is also concerned about this "New Editor" they keep hearing about. Some want to try it out, others like things the way it is now because of training</li>



<li>Client 2 is questioning why you selected Grav for their project though and wants you to review if they should be using WordPress because of other projects they're doing</li>



</ul>
