<p>You live in the world of Stranger Things. I know, it's hard to envision, it's why it's such a good show. Old people like your instructor, actually remember parts of the 80s and what it was like to not know where people were at all times.</p>

A lost art from the 80s was designing for interfaces that were primitive. Often times years would be lost trying to design simple things like joysticks and monitors to present primitive games with only a few options. But, these systems are universally approachable and the constrains put on the technology of the day helped inform this.</p>

<p>Now we live in a world without constraints which often leads to less accessible, less usable experiences. That's where you come in...</p>
<p>Today, we're going to design an interface or interaction that would be heavily steeped in constraints in order to envision more accessible systems. Take an application like twitter, remove the screen, the auto updating and self refreshing interfaces, remove the trolling and memes; how would people be able to leverage twitter effectively. What prompts would make sense on a command line, or on a simple 1999 style website (text box, click to submit data, that's about it).</p>
<p>Twitter is too easy an example which is why I'm spelling it out here: that's because the 140 character limit previously on twitter was because it was envisioned as a way of initially bridging cellphones to contribute to the web. People would "log into twitter" by texting a special number and that text === tweet. Laughable to think about now, but it was the original design and simplicity that was possible via constraint based design.</p>
<h2>Now it's your turn</h2>
<p>Think of an interface you use (inventory management in a game, registering for a course, shopping online).</p>
<p>Now imagine that interface existed as a text-based computer program from the <b>1980s</b>
. How would you communicate visual elements and order items logically? The text-based story to make the initial design.Â  This will help you think about screen readers first.</p>
<p>Now imagine that the interface existing in the early <b>1990s</b>
 as only HTML. What HTML elements would you need? This will help you think about progressive enhancement (and making sites work without too much javascript).</p>
<p>Make a video explaining how an interface of your choice would look in 1980 and in 1990 and what aspects should carry forward to the modern web.</p>

<h2>Deliverable</h2>
<p>Using your HAXcms site, create a page named for the technology / interface you are going to imagine in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>Write a paragraph about the technology / link to media associated with it so everyone knows exactly what it is. Then write a paragraph about the key features that would translate to 80s technology and write a paragraph about the key features you would visualize in the 90s / basic html based web.</p>
<p>Record a 5 minute video explaining the technology and limiting factors that would need to be replicated in an 80s and 90s context. This could be done talking over very rough mock ups / user flow diagrams in draw.io or with fun memes / related concepts like the Squirrel Monkey folks do.</p>
<p>Embed this / add a link to your HAXcms page and then submit it to the <b>#lab12-a11y-design</b>
 channel in Slack.</p>
