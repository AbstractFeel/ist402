<p>There are no required course materials in the textbook form but there are digital services you'll need to purchase for one of our Labs which will have usage in multiple labs in the future. These services are hosting from <a href="https://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a>


 and a domain name from a registrar like <a href="https://hover.com/">Hover</a>


 or <a href="https://domains.google.com">Google Domains</a>


.</p>
<h3 class="hax-active">Referral link</h3>
<p><a href="https://m.do.co/c/1fd5a3e0425d">ELMS:LN / HAXTheWeb referral link</a>

</p>
<p>If you use this referral link you should get at least 1 month free. <b>This is linked to an account the university uses</b>

 for people to get access to HAXcms and ELMS:LN demos in a safe, offsite location. This is also my way of saying that I don't benefit personally from you using Digital Ocean, I just like their simplicity.</p>
<p>These services were selected for price point and ease of use. We will be going through all the steps of setting up a new server on Digital Ocean (which involves clicking buttons basically) and then getting our custom domain name wired up to the Digital Ocean server.</p>
<p>There are $5/month plans on Digital Ocean and domain names can typically be purchased for $12.99/year though can run as low as $5 when on sale. After class is over it's up to you if you want to keep paying for hosting / keep your domain name active but expect to spend between $25 and $50 depending on service you sign up for and domain name cost.</p>
<p>Paying more will get you access to faster server resources but are not required for what we're going to execute on the machine.Â <span style="font-size: var(--haxcms-base-styles-p-font-size, 24px); letter-spacing: var(--haxcms-base-styles-p-letter-spacing, 0.5px); caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">We will be setting up the server and talking about how to wire things up most likely as part of our 4th lab session of the semester.</span></p>
