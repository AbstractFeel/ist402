<p>All assignments are setup as labs and you'll be starting into them at the end of class. Once finished with the lab, <b>you'll demonstrate you've done the work by reflecting on it in the form of a written response as well as a video response. Scroll down to read both. Yes I enjoy bold text.</b>
</p>
<h3 class="hax-active">Written response</h3>
<p>To each technology, I'd like you to write a short blog post that reads like a one-page white paper about the technology at hand. Try to keep it to around 500 words but thoroughness is more important then "did I make the paper long enough".</p>
<p>As long as it answers questions like the following:</p>
<ul><li>What is it and why does it exist</li>
<li>What industries use it / who are players that popularize it?</li>
<li>What alternatives exist to it?</li>
<li>Links / Resources for people who want to learn more about it</li>
<li>What you struggled with in using it?</li>
<li>What you liked most about using it?</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;" class="hax-active">Video response</span></h3>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Explainer videos are great, especially for people on the go via podcasts or who are looking to get a refresher on a topic before a meeting. Make a 3-5 minute screencast that sets up what the topic is, and runs through some brief examples of it. This is open to interpretation but you are trying to explain to others why this topic is valuable and when they'd use it.</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="hax-active">Say quickly who you are</span></li>
<li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Explain in 30 seconds what the topic is, who's using it or why it's useful</span></li>
<li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Talk about the topic while showing a demo of it or place you found most useful to learn</span></li>
<li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Show links to resources where you can learn more about it</span></li>
<li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Awesome sign off phrase to remember you by</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Here are a few examples of the kind of formality that is expected (flip on screencast software, record screen, talk). Part of the video reflection is to get more comfortable with speaking about technical concepts and to improve your ability to rationalize what your doing. I don't use a script (ever) for my videos but that's up to you.</span></p>
