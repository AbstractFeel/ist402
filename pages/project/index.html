<p>The last week of the semester there will be a slightly longer lab that I'm calling a project. You'll have to put together a pitch for one of multiple problem spaces but it's a technical pitch. You'll be asked to use as many technologies we used in the course to express how you'll solution will utilize these technologies, while it still being in the form of a pitch.</p>
<p>This will be explained more as we go into the course but it's effectively a double lab as far as points and time involved. <b>There is no final exam so it's just a final project.</b>

<h2>Final project problem identification</h2>
<p>Identify a topic in your current or past courses that was poorly covered or you felt was something that you could have Google’d and done a better job<br/></p>
<ul><li>Do this now in class</li>
<ul><li>If you can think of one, cool</li>
<li>If not, take time now and find one</li>
</ul>
<li><span>Pitch me (in Slack) the topic</span></li>
<li><span><b>I have to approve the topic (it just has to be </b>
<b>relevant</b>
<b> and something that can be covered in depth over 10-20 pages of content / media)</b>
</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Deliverable</h2>
<p>Create a comprehensive resource in <a href="https://iam.hax.psu.edu">https://iam.hax.psu.edu</a>
 that covers your approved topic in detail and <b>with a variety of engaging elements. </b>
This should be a topic poorly covered in a class you are / have taken OR A topic that you feel has been lacking in proper coverage in your major!<br/></p>
<p>Create two persuasive videos that make the case for OER and specifically your resource to two different audiences</p>
<h2>Video 1</h2>
<p>Create a video that “sells” an instructor on why they should use the resource you created over one from a publisher</p>
<p> Demonstrate how easy it is to create / modify</p>
<p>Identify open resources you used to help create your resource</p>
<p>Identify resources (services offered, websites, technologies, etc) <b>at Penn State</b>
 that faculty can leverage to produce more OER<br/></p>
<h2>Video 2</h2>
<p>There is a curricular rewrite in your college and <b>Associate Dean Fusco</b>
 is reviewing topics. Pitch AD Fusco on why this topic should be a core piece of the curriculum and is important for people in your major to learn from YOUR perspective!</p>
<p>AD Fusco <i>is very technical too</i>
. So, sell him on how <b>hax.psu.edu</b>
 could be <b><i>used by other faculty</i>
</b>
 (either through demonstration or draw.io diagrams to explain possibilities).</p>
<p>Here are some possible reasons: sustainability, accessibility, remixability, SEO, good press, portability of content, maintenance, etc.</p>
