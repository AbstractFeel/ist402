<p>Slides about CPanel & GravCMS from class</p>
<p>This week kicks off <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim hosting</a>
 and our Content Management System section of the course. We're going to be covering four different content management systems in this section of the course leveraging <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim hosting</a>
 to skip a lot of the tediousness of setting up and playing with a CMS.</p>
<p>Listing CMS "Site building" skills on a resume is a sure fire way to get noticed by certain companies looking for people who can hit the ground running with their internal systems. It demonstrates that you know how to navigate technical systems and can be taught out to administer them (potentially).</p>
<p>It's also a bit crazy as CMSs really are just big storage houses of information with text editors and other UIs that help streamline getting large groups of media and content on the web. The crazy part is, this really isn't that hard to do (as we'll demonstrate through these units) but a lot of people are so afraid of them that they won't touch them.</p>
<p>Master any one of these popular CMSs coming up (especially Drupal coming up) and you'll stand out in any organization that manages web projects or interfaces regularly with the web properties of the company directly.</p>
