<p>Slides will be available after class.</p>
<p>Today we're going to have a guest lecturer, Nikki Massaro-Kauffman, User Experience and Accessibility lead on all things HAXTheWeb. Nikki joined the ELMS:LN project through College of Arts and Architecture Office of Digital Learning at the end of 2017 and has been instrumental in the team's move to Web Components for all development work.</p>
<p>Nikki is an incredible resource for all things usable accessibility and user experience design and is a key reason for the rise in visibility of HAX and ELMS related projects.</p>
