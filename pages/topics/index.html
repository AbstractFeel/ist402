<h3 class="hax-active">Topic / semester outline</h3>
<p>Here's the proposed topics I've come up with to start. We may deviate from here as far as timing or how long we spend on different ones.</p>
<ul><li>Week 1 - Establishing an online identity as an
IT Professional (Vlogger)</li>










<ul><li>Treating ourselves as brands, we will establish
accounts and begin to setup the foundation for submission of assignments
throughout the semester</li>










</ul>










<li>Week 2 – Git / Github / Contribution (All roles)</li>










<ul><li>Collaborative participation on Github,
understanding concepts of Git / version control and how teams leverage this
technology for code and <b style="font-size: var(--haxcms-base-styles-p-font-size, 24px); letter-spacing: var(--haxcms-base-styles-p-letter-spacing, 0.5px); caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">non-code
projects</b>








</li>








</ul>








<ul>

</ul>










<li><span style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">Week 3 - HTML / CSS / JavaScript & the web (Front end)</span></li>










<ul><li>The big three powering most of what you use
today, a primer for reverse engineering. We’ll use codepen to demonstrate how
you can extend concepts of github into other realms</li>




</ul>










<li>Week 4 - Web components & Package management & Progressive Web
Apps (Front end)</li>










<ul><li>HTML on steroids and the future of all
application development, web or otherwise</li>










<li>We’ll look at why this is transformative for
application development and why all teams should be exploring it from an
efficiency perspective. We’ll also experiment with a powerful new platform
called Stackblitz to demonstrate the power of Package management +
compartmentalized HTML</li>




<li>NPM / Composer and how we stand on the shoulders of giants</li>




</ul>




<li>Week 5 - Reclaim Hosting & CPanel & GravCMS</li>




<ul><li>We're going to dig into <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/"><b>Reclaim</b>




 <b>hosting</b>




</a>




 for the next several lessons and to give us a server to deploy CMSs on. CMSs come in different shapes and sizes and this will kick off several weeks looking at different CMSs in depth</li>




<li><b>Reclaim</b>




 uses <a href="https://cpanel.net/">CPanel</a>




 - A hosting management platform which makes installing new applications a click away. We'll explore the CPanel interface and open the door to installing and experimenting with many different applications.</li>




<li>We'll use GravCMS as our first vehicle into CPanels powers. GravCMS is a powerful yet simple static file driven website. It's built in PHP yet reads off <b>Markdown</b>




 files in order to generate content. We'll explore the GravCMS user interface, learn why people use it and look at some sites built using it.</li>




</ul>




<li>Week 6 - <a href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal CMS</a>




</li>




<ul><li>We'll look at the Drupal community, it's history, structure and learn about why it's popular at a high level</li>




<li>We'll dig into the Drupal UI and look at the more powerful aspects of it as to why people put up for lack of UX in exchange for raw power like User / role management and entity / field management</li>




<li>We'll setup a basic Drupal site in <b>Reclaim</b>




 <b>hosting</b>




 to explore the guts of our own real working Drupal site.</li>




</ul>




<li>Week 7 - <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress CMS</a>




</li>




<ul><li>We'll look at the WordPress community and platform as it is the worlds most used open source CMS, thought to power some 30+% of all websites</li>




<li>We'll dig into the WordPress UI, look at the Gutenberg editor, and see why more people build smaller websites using WordPress than any other platform out there today</li>




<li>We'll setup a basic WordPress site in <b>Reclaim</b>




 <b>hosting</b>




 to explore the guts of our own real working WordPress site.</li>

</li>










<ul><li>We’ll have a mid-term based on the technologies and skills covered the 1<sup style="letter-spacing: var(--haxcms-base-styles-p-letter-spacing, 0.5px); caret-color: var(--hax-color-text); font-weight: bold;">st</sup>

</ul>










<li>Week 9 - Open source communities & <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/haxcms">HAXcms</a>




 (All roles)</li>










<ul><li>We’ll review governance within open source
communities, understand the difference between licenses, learn how different structures operate (including Open vs Closed), see how to identify
healthy vs stagnated open source communities, and learn when people fallback to proprietary technologies. ELMS:LN / HAXcms had to go through a formal audit from the <a href="https://apereo.org/">Apereo Foundation</a>




, so I'll provide insight into what got us certified as a well formed software community.</li>








<li>We'll try to identify gaps in on boarding into a community and help improve the documentation associated with this by installing and experimenting with HAXcms, a system I've dubbed an <b>organic static site generator</b>




.</li>




</ul>




<li>Week 10 – Servers, Terminal and Command line basics and DDOS (Sys admin)<br/></li>




<ul>
<li><span style="caret-color: var(--hax-color-text);">Step by step through the basic commands that system developers use to make everything work</span><br/></li>

</ul>




<ul>


<li>We'll play with https://surge.sh/ for static publishing</li>










</ul>










<li>Week 11 – Accessibility (Front end / Developer)</li>










<ul><li>What is it, why is it important, who benefits,
how do we test for it?</li>




<li>We'll use Lighthouse and Wave to test different websites and parse through the reports</li>




<li>We'll also have a guest speaker from the university who works in disability services, Sonya Woods, to talk about accessibility and her job as a specialist in this field.</li>










</ul>










<li>Week 12 - User experience (Front end / Designer)</li>










<ul><li>Persona creation and testing using real world
applications</li>










</ul>










<li>Week 13 - Server Virtualization technologies (DevOps)</li>










<ul><li>Vagrant and Docker have changed the web forever,
we’ll explore these and surrounding applications and learn why they are so
powerful</li>

<li>We’ll look at OER / open course technology
movements from philosophical, societal and technological perspectives.</li>










<li>We’ll audit systems the instructor works on /
has worked on to identify gaps in existing technologies, critique what’s
available and ideate about how technologies discussed throughout the class can
be leveraged</li>










<li><b>These labs will be combined into a single submission with 10% of the grade. Lab time will be spent learning about the context and having access to instructors to help while exploring the topic.</b>
