<li>When you include links, videos, images, etc in your video, try to copy and paste the link into the description on YouTube. This helps others explore the topics in greater detail</li>
<li>Frame topics in a vacuum, not in the context of our course. No one cares you are taking this course except you and me, next year someone might care about how to make a <b>Pull Request</b>
</li>
<li>Be mindful of time. It's hard (for me too) but the 2.5 to 5 minute target helps with engagement as well as helps you refine your words when speaking about topics fluidly (remember, job interview, on point, not wordy)</li>
