<h3><span style="letter-spacing: -0.48px;">Lab 2</span></h3>
<ul><li>When you include links, videos, images, etc in your video, try to <b>copy and paste the link into the description on <i>YouTube</i>


</b>


. This helps others explore the topics in greater detail (general screen-caster tip)<br/></li>


<li>Frame topics in a vacuum, not in the context of our course. Act like this is a video you're making just to explain a topic to explain it. Next year someone might care about how to make a <b>Pull Request </b>


and learn from you, they won't know (or care) about IST 402 or that it's for school</li>


<ul><li><b>Job interview</b>


: I know how to do X, I can explain Y. Less <i>In class I learned about X, </i>


I did an <i>assignment once</i>


 about Y.</li>


</ul>



<li>Be mindful of time. It's hard (for me too) but the 2.5 to 5 minute target helps with engagement as well as helps you refine your words when speaking about topics fluidly</li>


<ul><li><b>Job interview</b>


: Be on point, precise in language, exacting in explanations and you demonstrate confidence in the topic matter.</li>


</ul>



<li>WRITE BEFORE SPEAKING. The blogging / writing aspect of the lab response is to help practice technical writing but also to frame your thoughts and find words that work for concepts.</li>


<ul><li>500 words == 5 minutes; 300, 3 minutes; these values are to help you get more exact in your language both written and verbal</li>


</ul>


<li><i>Walking and Chewing Gum is difficult</i>


 - You are not being judged on accuracy of things like "Did you issue the pull request perfectly that one time". Try to demonstrate the concept on video, live. Practice once beforehand if it helps smooth things out.</li>


<ul><li><b>Job interview</b>


: Thinking on the fly, not planned out canned responses to things. Fluid conversation mixing in and out of technical concepts isn't easy, that's why we're practicing it.</li>


</ul>


<li>To those treating this like a brand / identity, keep doing what your doing, many of these are flipping fantastic!</li>

<h3>Lab 1</h3>
<ul><li>ABOB (made up acronym) - Always Be On Brand. Similar account names, same photos, interlink social accounts with writing with posts</li>





<li>Always leave 2-3 seconds on the front and back of a screencast</li>




<li>Do an audio levels check</li>




<li>Shoot for the same style sign on and sign off</li>
