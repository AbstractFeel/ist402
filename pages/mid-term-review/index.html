<p>See slides from topic 7 on Drupal. There are several examples with answers in the front of the slide deck you can use to review the types of questions you'll be asked.</p>
<p>This is an "open web" review. The real world you can google things if you get stuck and this is no different. Now, you can't take credit for other people's work in my class or IRL, so the TA will be proctoring this exam and ensuring that everyone's responsible for their own work.</p>
<p>After the exam please answer the course survey questions to give us feedback on how class has done so far and where to go.</p>
