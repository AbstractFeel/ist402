<h3 class="hax-active">Checklist</h3>
<p>Before recording always make sure...</p>
<ul><li>You've got the links you want to view open in tabs in a browser window</li>
<li>You've got headphones / some kind of microphone to record your voice</li>
<ul><li>You can use internal microphones but the quality on them is pretty bad so try to use a headset / earbuds if you have them</li>
</ul>

<li>You've authorized whatever it is to record your voice and test that audio is working!</li>
<ul><li>I fell victim to this many times early on</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Next you'll need to pick a screen casting tool to do the recording. I recommend one of the following.</p>
<h3>Zoom (Free)</h3>

</p>
<p>Penn state labs come with zoom installed. You can also install this on your personal device and should be able to do recordings from it. I recommend finding a quite place that you can bring headphones since you'll have to do voice over describing what's on screen and explaining it to others.</p>
<h3>Screencastify (Free, ad based with paid option)</h3>

</p>
<p>I just found this recently, it's a browser plugin for Chrome. If <i>you're O.K. with the permissions that it requires</i>
, it's a very easy to use way of generating a screencast.</p>
<h3 class="hax-active">Snagit (Paid)</h3>
<p><b>Link</b>

</p>
<p>I use Snagit personally for all of my screen casting that I do. It is $30 but comes with some basic ways of doing quick editing and image mock up as well. It's not required that you use Snagit by any means, just saying what I've had positive experiences with previously.</p>
<p>Others</p>
<p>If you find others that you like feel free to share them with the class. The purpose of this class is not to get into high end video editing so beware that it is expected you'll generate videos each week. The content of the video is what matters, not fancy intros or well cut jumps or anything like that. Being able to fluidly communicate about a technical concept and teach others about how to use it and what it is.</p>
