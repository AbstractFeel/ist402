<p>We're going to strive for this general flow to each week of the semester. A few specific topics will deviate and we may have some guest speakers, but generally this is what class will look like together</p>
<ul><li>Capability / skill / technology of the day with quick discussion of what people think that's for, or places they've heard of it previously</li>
<li>A brief lecture (25 - 30 min) about the skill, who uses it, and how it's put into practice. This is taking the concept into the theory realm.</li>
<li>Screw theory, we're only going to learn by getting our hands dirty! We'll take a quick break to prep the keyboards. (10 min for questions, 5 min break)</li>
<li>Next we'll all follow along doing a very basic example of the skill. This might be running commands in a terminal or hooking up a new IFTTT command to Github via the UI. Something that's all of us following along and doing it together, stopping to answer any questions along the way.</li>
<li>The rest of the time from here is open lab. We'll have a lab with a few options for experiencing and implementing the skill in practice.</li>
<li>What ever you don't get done in class is to be completed after class but we'll always start on the work together in case there are issues.</li>
</ul>
